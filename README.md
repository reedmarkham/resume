# Reed Markham's Resume

[![](https://badgen.net/github/license/thehale/expressive-resume)](https://github.com/thehale/expressive-resume/blob/master/LICENSE)

A beautiful resume/cover letter LaTeX template pair that are extraordinarily
easy to use. 

Integrating GitHub Actions to automatically compile PDF copies of newly-edited files.

## Implementation

Clone this repo locally.

Edit any of the `.cls` files to adjust the base themes, types, etc.

Edit either of the `.tex` files to adjust the actual resume or cover letter.

Commits to any branch will generate PDFs of each as artifacts on the relevant workflow run.
