# Reed Markham's Resume

An implementation of Joseph Hale's [Expressive Resume](https://github.com/thehale/expressive-resume/blob/master/LICENSEhttps://badgen.net/github/license/thehale/expressive-resume) and Xu Cheng's [LaTeX Action](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action), integrating a workflow to automatically compile PDF copies of newly-edited files.

## Usage

Clone this repo locally.

Edit any of the `.cls` files to adjust the base themes, types, etc.

Edit either of the `.tex` files to adjust the actual resume or cover letter.

Commits to any branch that update any of these files above will generate PDFs as artifacts of the respective workflow run.

## Where can I find the resume or cover letter?
