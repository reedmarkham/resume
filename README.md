# Reed Markham's Resume

Combining Joseph Hale's [Expressive Resume](https://github.com/thehale/expressive-resume/blob/master/LICENSEhttps://badgen.net/github/license/thehale/expressive-resume) and Xu Cheng's [LaTeX Action](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action) to deploy a LaTeX-generated resume and cover letter as PDF files using GitHub Actions.

## Usage

* Clone this repo locally.
* Edit any of the `.cls` files to modify the LaTeX classes used in the resume and/or cover letter.
* Edit either of the `.tex` files to write the actual resume or cover letter.
* Commit to any branch, updating any of these files above, to generate PDFs as artifacts of the respective workflow run (see below).
